            <h2><b>TAJ MAHAL</b></h2>
            <p>One of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal is undoubtedly India's most famous monument. It looms evocatively from the banks of the Yamuna River. Mughal emperor Shah Jahan had it built as a mausoleum for third wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who died in 1631. Construction took place over 16 years, from 1632 to 1648.
            The Taj Mahal is made out of white marble but its color captivatingly appears to gradually alter in the changing light of the day.</p>

            <h2><b>FATEHPUR SIKRI</b></h2>
            <p>Fatehpur Sikri, near Agra in Uttar Pradesh, was once the proud but short-lived capital of the Mughal Empire in the 16th century. Emperor Akbar founded the city from the twin villages of Fatehpur and Sikri in 1569, as tribute to famous Sufi saint Sheikh Salim Chishti. The saint accurately predicted the birth of Emperor Akbar's much longed for son.
                Not long after Fatehpur Sikri was completed, it unfortunately had to be abandoned by its occupants as the water supply was insufficient.</p>

            <h2><b>JALLIANWALA BAGH</b></h2>
            <p>Jallianwala Bagh, near the Golden Temple in Amritsar, is the site of a sad but defining moment in India's history and struggle for freedom. On April 13, 1919, British troops opened fire on a large group of more than 10,000 unarmed protesters, in what is known as the Amritsar Massacre.
            The British didn't give any warning of the shooting. Official records indicate that about 400 people were killed and another 1,200 injured. The unofficial tally is much higher though. Many people died in stampedes and by jumping into a well to escape being shot.</p>

            <h2><b>GATEWAY OF INDIA</b></h2>
            <p>Mumbai's most recognizable monument, the Gateway of India, occupies a commanding position overlooking the Arabian Sea at the harbor in Colaba. It was built commemorate the visit of King George V and Queen Mary's to the city in 1911. However, it wasn't completed until 1924.
            The Gateway of India subsequently played a significant part in India's history. The last British troops departed through it in 1948, when India obtained Independence.</p>

            <h2><b>RED FORT</b></h2>
            <p>The fort was built as a palace by fifth Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan, when he shifted his capital from Agra to Delhi in 1638. The capital, known as Shahjahanabad, was where Old Delhi is today. Much of the development took place around Chandni Chowk, the chaotic and crumbling market area adjoining the Red Fort.
            The Mughals occupied the fort for almost 200 years, until it was lost to the British in 1857. When India obtained Independence on August 15, 1947, the first Prime Minister of India (Jawahar Lal Nehru) unfurled the Indian flag from the fort's ramparts. </p>
